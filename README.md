# Shaw and Partners' Private Test: Github Profile Viewer

This is a project created for a Private Evaluation Test that uses the [Github Users API](https://developer.github.com/v3) to show Github user's profiles and repositories.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Packages used:

- [React Js](https://react.dev/)
- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Date-fns](https://date-fns.org/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
- [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The CSS was inspired on SankThomas' [github-users](https://github.com/SankThomas/github-users) project.

### Note: This project was made for an application for a Fullstack Developer Position, however I could only manage to do the Front-End Test.
